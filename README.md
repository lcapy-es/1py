# serial-com-arduino
this project builds on that [project](http://sherlin.xbot.es/proyectos/proyecto-laser-y-fibra-optica). 
I tried modifying it to use Arduino Mega to replace the Max232 because my PC has no serial ports. 
If you use another type of arduino you need to change the .ino file because probably only arduino mega has multiple ports. 
No need to use laser either, just replace it with a wire or jumper.
